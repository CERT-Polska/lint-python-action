# lint-python-action

Tool that runs common linters on CERT Polska projects written in Python.

Includes [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) custom action.

Used linters and auto-formatters are:

```
pip install -U isort==5.10.1 black==22.6.0 flake8==4.0.1 mypy==0.971
```

## Installation

```console
$ pip install lint-python
```

## How to configure lint-python?

Provide configuration in [pyproject.toml](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) file.

```toml
[tool.lint-python]
lint-version = "2"
source = "lint_python/" # Put your source directory
extra-requirements = "types-requests"  # Provide additional typing requirements if needed
use-mypy = false  # Turn off any tool you don't want to use
```

Tools are opt-out, so if you don't use static typing in your project, you can turn off any tool from linting.

If you use Github Actions, you can add it to any steps of the workflow e.g. `.github/workflows/test.yml`

```yaml
name: Test the code
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: CERT-Polska/lint-python-action@v2
        with:
          source: karton/
```

Tool can be configured via `with` parameters, but they must be provided directly. 
Don't use any expansion because lint-python tool parses the workflow file on its own.

## How to use it?

```console
$ lint-python
INFO:root:Linting with isort
INFO:root:Linting with black
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
3 files left unchanged.
INFO:root:Linting with flake8
INFO:root:Linting with mypy
Success: no issues found in 3 source files
```

If you want to only perform a check without modifying files, use `--check` flag
```console
$ lint-python --check
```

If you have not installed packages and tools required for linting, use `--install` flag or `--install-only` flag if
you don't want to lint immediately after successful installation.
```console
$ lint-python --install
```

Try `--help` for more settings.

## Tips for linting your own project

If you want to introduce these linters into your project, some tools need to be preconfigured to cooperate correctly. 
Check https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/using_black_with_other_tools.html for more information.

Our recommended settings are:

```toml
# in pyproject.toml file:
[tool.isort]
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
use_parentheses = true
ensure_newline_before_comments = true
line_length = 88
```

```ini
# in .flake8, setup.cfg or tox.ini file:
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = E203, W503
```
